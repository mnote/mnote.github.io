### alias reusing

Simply wrap your reused alias with (SELECT alias)

    SELECT 10 AS my_num, 
           (SELECT my_num) * 5 AS another_number
    FROM table

Aliases in sql are not like variables in a programming language. Aliases can only be referenced again at certain points (particularly in GROUP BY and HAVING clauses). But you can't reuse an alias in the SELECT clause. 

Or you could just duplicate the work:

    SELECT 10 AS my_num, 10 * 5 AS another_number FROM table;
