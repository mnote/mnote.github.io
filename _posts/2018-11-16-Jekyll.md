## GitHub Pages

* Free, reliable static site hosting

* Fully contained within git repository and integrated with GitHub

* Perfect for documentation and microsites

### How Does it Work?

* GitHub Pages is triggered automagically™ by pushing to specially named branches of GitHub repositories

* For most repositories, the **branch** should be named `gh-pages` or `docs` in `master` branch

* All files in your repository will be transparently published each time you push to GitHub

* If your repository is normally available at `github.com/[username]/[reponame]`, it will become available as a website hosted at `[username].github.com/[reponame]`

* If you want to have a "vanity" site that appears at `[username].github.io`, simply create a **repository** named `[username].github.io` and use the `master` branch, instead of the `gh-pages` **branch**

* Certain files are treated in a special way


## Jekyll

* Jekyll is written in Ruby. Jekyll itself is a gem as well as many Jekyll plugins. 
  
  A *gem* is code you can include in Ruby projects. It allows you to package up functionality and share it across other projects or with other people.
  
  A *Gemfile* is a list of gems required for your site.
  
  *Bundler* installs the gems in your Gemfile. It’s not a requirement for you to use a Gemfile and bundler however it’s highly recommended as it ensures you’re running the same version of Jekyll and Jekyll plugins across different environments.

* In addition to static file hosting, every push to GitHub Pages is transparently run through a powerful yet simple *templating engine* called `Jekyll`

* Since Jekyll sites are stored as static files, they are the fastest sites around and scale beautifully

* Jekyll allows you to organize pages by common, reused templates, and helps you to build larger sites in a more manageable way


### Jekyll Basics

* As a reminder, any file in the *gh-pages* branch of your repository will be transparently served via GitHub Pages including CSS, HTML, images, javascript, etc.

* If you don't want a file or folder to be accessible via the web, simply start the filename with an underscore (_).Otherwise, all files are run through Jekyll by default

* `jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called *_site*

* `jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at *http://localhost:4000*

#### [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)

install ruby:  
`curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --auto-dotfiles --autolibs=enable --ruby`

add to ~/.bash_profile:  
`[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"`

`source ~/.bash_profile`

`rvm list`  
`ruby -v`  
`gem list`  
`gem env`  

`gem install bundler`

`gem update --system`  
`gem update jekyll` 

Gemfile and [GitHub Pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem):  
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'github-pages'
  gem 'jekyll-paginate'
end
```

Install Jekyll and other dependencies from the GitHub Pages gem:
`bundle install`

List dependency versions: 
`bundle exec github-pages versions`

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

`gem update github-pages`
`bundle update github-pages`

### Yaml

* Jekyll uses a a simple format called YAML to organize **file properties**

* YAML (or YML front matteras it is also called) often **lives at the top of a file surrounded by three - characters** on the lines above and below

* At its most basic level, YAML is simply a set of properties and values separated by a colon (:), e.g.:

	 ----
	 title: Hello world!
	 layout: page
	 ----

* Any text-bassed file, regardless of the filetype can be given YML

* Jekyll will strip the YML front matter (前页) before serving the file via GitHub pages

* YML front matter can control the file's presentation and is available within the template (more to come)

* If your file is within the `_posts` directory, you can omit the dashes entirely.

### Layouts

* Jekyll's most powerful (and simplest) feature is called "layouts"

* A layout is simply a predefined HTML (or anything really) template which helps Jekyll render content more beautifullyer

* Layouts live in the `_layouts` folder (you may have to create this initially)

### Template Data

* In addition to layouts, Jekyll also provides some more advanced template features

* Any field in the YML front matter can be displayed in the page using the format of `{{ page.property }}` where property is the value before the colon

* This helps to further separate the page's layout from information about the page

* You can also add YAML to a file named `_config.yml`, and it will be available to all templates as `{{ site.key }}` using the same format


### Includes

* Includes allow you to reuse common elements

* Includes live in the `_includes` folder, and can be in any format

* Includes can be dropped into a file using the format `\{\% include [file] %\}`, where `[file]` is the file you want to include

* To include `_includes/sidebar.html` for example, simply add `\{\% include sidebar.html %\}` to the **layout**

* Note includes use the `\{\% ... %\}` format, while printing template data uses the { { ... } } format
