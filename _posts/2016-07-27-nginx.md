config syntax
-------------

* /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

* All lines preceded by a pound sign or hash (#) are comments.

* Settings begin with the _variable_ name and then state an _argument_ or series of _arguments_ separated by _spaces_. Examples include `worker_processes 1;` and `error_log logs/error.log notice;`. All statements end with a _semicolon (;)_.

* Some settings, like the events variable above, have arguments that are themselves settings with arguments. All sub-directives are enclosed in one set of curly brackets ({ }).

* Tabs or multiple spaces are interpreted by nginx as a single space. Using tabs or spaces for indentation in a standardized way will greatly improve the readability of your file and make it easier to maintain.


nuts and bolts
--------------

When a `location` directive is followed by a tilde (`~`), Nginx performs a regular expression match. These matches are always case-sensitive. 

If you want matches to be case insensitive, use a tilde with an asterisk (`~*`)

Adding a caret and tilde (`^~`) to your location directives tells Nginx, if it makes a match for a particular string, to stop searching for more specific matches and use the directives here instead. 

Finally, if you add an equals sign (`=`) to the location setting, this forces an exact match with the path requested and then stops searching for more specific matches.

The document `root` is located in the specified directory

The `index` variable tells Nginx which file to serve if none is specified. If multiple files are specified for the index directive, Nginx will process the list in order and fulfill the request with the first file that exists.
