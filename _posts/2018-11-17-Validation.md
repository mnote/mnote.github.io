###
Applying validation at the data-model level is both convenient and natural; it gives data modelers and data architects the chance to build validation infrastructure at the same time as (or shortly after) data model creation. One thing to remember with data-model validation is to make sure that your data model is used faithfully at all layers of your application. Used in this way, your validation infrastructure will be available whenever you need it.
