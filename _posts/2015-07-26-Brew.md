Homebrew:  
    The missing package manager for OS X.

[Brew home](http://brew.sh)

Install:

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

	brew update

	brew install git

	which git


	brew install ant

	brew uninstall thrift

	brew list --versions

If you are getting errors installing Brew, try uninstalling first using the command:

		rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup

Using Homebrew:

	brew uninstall --force maven

	brew install maven
	#will install Maven 3.3.x

	#brew install maven30
	#will install Maven 3.0 which should be better
	#brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/master/maven30.rb
	#brew uninstall maven30

### Homebrew repository

Note: I've seen that command fail sometimes because of a bug. If that ever happens, run the following (when you have Git installed):

	$ cd /usr/local
	$ git fetch origin
	$ git reset --hard origin/master

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

	$ brew outdated

To update a package:

	$ brew upgrade <formula>

Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

	$ brew cleanup

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

	$ brew list --versions
