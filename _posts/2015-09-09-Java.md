### Package Info

Prior to Java 5, package level documentation (the documentation shown in Javadocs for a package) was placed in package.html.
Today, the description and other related documentation for a package can be written up in the package-info.java file and it gets used in the production of the Javadocs.

### Package Annotations

Perhaps more importantly to today’s annotation driven programmer, the package-info.java file contains package level annotations. 
An annotation with ElementType.PACKAGE as one of its targets is a package-level annotation and there are many of them.  Using your favorite IDE’s code assistant (shown in Eclipse below) in a package-info.java file and you will find a number package annotation options.



### Mac Java

While I'm not sure how to change it at runtime, you can set at the command line your Dock icon using the -Xdock:icon option, like:

 >java -Xdock:icon=/path/myIcon.png myApp
This article has lots of useful little info about bringing java apps to Mac, and you may be interested looking at the utilities and tools for Mac listed here, 
as well as deployment options listed here (the last link is especially useful if you want to go down the Java Webstart route).
