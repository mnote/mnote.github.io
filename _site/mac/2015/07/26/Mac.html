<p>Where does the App Store download its files to?</p>

<p>It’s possible that update files were corrupted. Try to remove these files and re-try again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/private/var/folders</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Terminal check if you’ve temporary files here:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -la /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then try to remove them (you may backup them first just in case):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rm -frv /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or eventually run Finder and go to: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/private/var/folders</code> and Trash all the folders 
(if something bad happens, restore it from your Trash).</p>

<p>And re-try again.</p>

<p>Removing all the folders from <code class="highlighter-rouge">/private/var/folders</code> it actually fixed the problem on my laptop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.danrodney.com/mac/">Mac keyboard shortcuts 2</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/317935/top-10-mac-keyboard-shortcuts/">Mac keyboard shortcuts 3</a></p>

<p>Command-Q – Quit any program: If you’re coming from a Windows computer, you might have gotten used to “X-ing out” of your applications by clicking on the X button at the top of any application window. In OS X, you close windows with the red X button (in the upper left of your window), but it will not quit the app. To fully exit out of any Mac program in OS X, you’ll need to use the Quit command with this shortcut, or click on the app menu, then choose Quit.</p>

<p>Command-W, Option-Command-W – The first of these will close whatever active window you are using, while the second one will close all the windows in the currently active app (or Finder, which is also an app, really). These shortcuts will do the same thing as the Close Window option in the Finder and most other apps. Chrome, for example, delineates between Close Window (Command-W) and Close Tab (Command-Shift-W).</p>

<p>Command-T – Whether you’re in a web browser like Safari or Chrome or in the Finder itself, this keyboard shortcut will open a new tab for you. In Chrome, Command-Shift-T will open the most recently closed tab for you. Keep hitting this shortcut to open multiple tabs (or continue opening tabs in reverse chronological order in Chrome).</p>

<p>Command-Tab, Command-~ – The first of these shortcuts will activate Mac OS X’s built-in application switcher, which will let you switch between active apps running on your Mac. Keep holding down the Command key and press Tab repeatedly to go to the next app from left to right. Use Command-~ (tilde, usually above the Tab key) to switch to running apps from right to left. Holding down the Command key and hitting Q will quit whatever program you are currently highlighting.</p>

<p>Command-X, Command-C, Command-V – Cut, Copy, and Paste are three of the things I do most often in my writing life, so using a mouse to head up to the Edit menu in an app to choose them from a menu makes me cringe. Learn these three essential shortcuts (X for cut, C for copy, and V for paste–go figure), and you’ll save a ton of time every day.</p>

<p>Command-F – Search is a massive part of any computer user’s workflow, from finding the right document to looking for a key word or phrase in Safari. To find something in the Finder, Safari or Chrome, or in a Pages or Word document, simply hit the Command-F key combination and a little window will show up where you can type in your search terms. Boom – you’ll find what you need.</p>

<p>Command-Shift-3, Command-Shift-4 – Screenshots are a way of life in my own daily work, and I’m willing to bet you’ve needed to take a quick shot of your screen at some point. Command-Shift-3 will take a picture of your entire Mac’s screen, from the upper left to the bottom right corner. Command-Shift-4 will turn your mouse cursor into a set of crosshairs (not unlike a sniper rifle sight) that you can then click and drag around any portion of your screen to just capture the relevant area. Pro tip: tap the spacebar once to just take a screenshot of a specific window, or hold the spacebar to move the selected area around without changing its dimensions.</p>

<p>Command-Shift-A, Command-Shift-U, Command-Shift-D, Command-Shift-H – In the Finder, you’ll need to navigate to any number of common folders: Applications, Utilities, Desktop, and Home. Simply hit the Command key and then the first letter of each of these to go directly to them, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.</p>

<p>Command-Option-Esc – If an app stops responding, you might need to force it to quit. You can do that with a right click on the app icon in the Dock, but it’s even easier if you hit this keyboard shortcut. This will bring up the Force Quit dialog, which you can then use to make that non-responsive app quit. You might need to Command-Tab your way out of an active frozen app first, though, or use Command + Shift + Option + Esc to quit the currently active app.</p>

<p>Command-H, Command-Option-H – Doing something at work you shouldn’t be when your boss walks by? Whoops! It’s an easy fix, though, to hit Command-H on your keyboard to hide the current active app. If you’re just needing to de-clutter your view, Command-Option-H will hide all the other apps in the background, letting you focus on the one in front.</p>

<h3 id="tab-switch-keyshort">Tab Switch Keyshort</h3>

<p>In most native OS X applications, the key presses <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd-Shift-[</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd-Shift-]</code> will cycle left and right through tabs, respectively.</p>

<p>In most recent Mac applications—including Safari, Mail, and most other programs that display text or let you edit text—just position the cursor over the word you want to define and then press <code class="highlighter-rouge">Control-Command-D</code>. A floating balloon appears containing the definition(s) of that word.</p>

<h3 id="popclip">PopClip</h3>

<p>There are several ways to tame PopClip, if you find that it appears when you don’t want it to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hold down the ⌘ or Fn key while selecting text, and PopClip will not appear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid PopClip showing up when using a particular application, add it to the Excluded Apps list in PopClip preferences. Click the ‘+’ button to show the file chooser, and select the application you want to add to the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tip: Holding ⌥ when clicking ‘+’adds the currently active application directly to the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can turn off PopClip completely by clicking the on/off button in the preferences panel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tip: Right-clicking the PopClip menu bar icon is a shortcut to toggle PopClip on/off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paste appears when you click editable text immediately after performing Copy or Cut using PopClip. To make Paste appear at other times (without selecting text), either hold down the mouse button for about half a second, or click twice in the same place.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://docs.pilotmoon.com/article/24-popclip-user-guide">PopClip</a></p>

<h3 id="text-selection">Text Selection</h3>

<p>Holding down Command while clicking and dragging lets you select disparate sections (i.e. noncontiguous regions) of text. You could highlight one sentence at the beginning of a paragraph, for example, and while holding down Command, select another sentence at the end of a paragraph. Hitting Command + C will copy both to the clipboard. If you hit Command + V to paste, the two sentence components will be pasted on two separate lines.</p>

<p>Holding down Option will let you select rectangular blocks of text within a paragraph. This is hard to describe, so give it a try by holding down Option and clicking and dragging within a paragraph of text (try Option + Command if this doesn’t work). Again, hitting Command + C will copy it and Command + V will paste it. It’s hard to imagine how this would ever be useful, but you might find a use for it!</p>

<p>By clicking at the beginning of the region you want to select, then holding Shift and clicking at the end of the region, you’ll select everything in between. If you’ve already made a text selection, you can hold down Shift and click on either side of it to add text to the selection. Clicking within the selection while holding down Shift will let you subtract letters and words from the selection.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-non-security-form">This is a non security form</h3>

<p>This form will be sent in a way that is not secure. Are you sure you want to send it?</p>

<p>Change the link to https:// instead of http:// So basically ad an “s” which let’s the browser know the link is secure. It doesn’t actually secure the page but it stops the error message. The problem happens when you are sending someone from an https page to an http page so it’s the transition that triggers the error message.</p>

<h3 id="wheel-group">wheel group</h3>

<p>Mac OS X has roots in BSD UNIX, a.k.a. the UNIX that came out of UC Berkeley. They had a group of trusted people that could become superuser by using the su command. So they coded their UNIX to only allow people in this specific group to become superuser using su. They chose the groupname ‘wheel’, supposedly reference to other systems that had WHEEL, possibly a reference to being a ‘big wheel’</p>

<p>It’s less important now that you have the GUI authorization popups and sudo. You can use sudo without being in wheel group I believe.</p>

<p>As far as how to change to wheel, chgrp should be your friend, once you’re root.</p>

<p>wheel is the group used by OSX for the ‘system’ /Applications. It was present since at least 1989-03-13 in the source of BSD Unix</p>

<h3 id="system-integrity-protection-sip">System Integrity Protection (SIP)</h3>

<p>Operation not permitted:</p>

<p>It is a new feature of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan): SIP.</p>

<p>System Integrity Protection (SIP,1 sometimes referred to as rootless2[3]) is a security feature of OS X El Capitan, the operating system by Apple Inc.</p>

<p>Among the protected locations are: /System, /bin, /sbin and /usr (but not /usr/local).</p>

<p>It can be disabled: Stack Exchange thread</p>

<p>In summary, from the Recovery partition, open Terminal.app and run: csrutil disable</p>

<p>Apple’s documentation covers disabling SIP: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899</p>

<p>This other article lists these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo appears on your screen.</li>
  <li>Click Utilities &gt; Terminal.</li>
  <li>In the Terminal window, type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">csrutil disable</code> and press Enter.</li>
  <li>Restart your Mac.</li>
  <li>
    <p>You can verify if a file or folder is restricted by issuing this ls command using the capital O (and not zero 0) to modify the long listing flag:</p>

    <p>ls -lO /System /usr</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Look for the restricted text to indicate where SIP is enforced. By default, the only directory from above that is without SIP is /usr/local/</p>
